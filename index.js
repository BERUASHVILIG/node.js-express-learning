// process.exit(3); //This syntax is the correct way to use the process.exit method.
// It exits the Node.js process with the specified exit code (in this case, 3).
// process.exit = 3; // This syntax is assigning the value 3 to the exit property of the process object,
//  which is not the intended use of process.exit.

// The process object is a global object in Node.js that provides information about the current Node.js process.
// It allows access to various properties and methods related to the process, such as environment variables,
// command-line arguments, and process-related events.
